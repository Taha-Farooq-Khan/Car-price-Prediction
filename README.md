As an intern at CodexCue, I recently completed an exciting project: building a car price prediction model. Let me take you through my journey and the steps I followed to create a robust model.

1. Data Exploration
Understanding the Dataset:

I delved into the dataset, examining the available features and their significance in predicting car prices.
2. Feature Engineering
Enhancing Information Capture:
I engineered new features and transformed existing ones to capture valuable information.
Feature engineering played a key role in improving model performance by providing more relevant input.
3. Model Selection and Training
I carefully selected appropriate regression models for predicting car prices.
Ensuring proper data splitting into training and testing sets, I trained these models to make accurate predictions.
4. Model Evaluation
Assessing Performance:
To evaluate model performance, I used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
These metrics helped me understand how well my models generalized to unseen data.
Going Beyond: Ensemble Methods and Cross-Validation
To enhance prediction accuracy:
I explored ensemble methods like Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression.
These techniques can further improve model robustness.
I also validated my modelâ€™s performance using cross-validation, ensuring reliability across different data subsets.
My experience at CodexCue has been enlightening, and Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and contributing to data science projects.
If you have any questions or insights, feel free to shareâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear from you! ðŸš€
